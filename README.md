# Codebase GraphRAG
[Work In Progress]
![Graph banner](assets/codebase_graph.png)


## The project
### Router LLM
- Semantic search + graph retrieval: Vector embedding similarity augmented with graph query to retrieve relevant nodes...
- Graph Cypher queries:
- Conversation memory:

### Knowledge graph configuration
The codebase is modeled as a knowledge graph. Inside the know Class, function and method definitions and calls are modeled as nodes in the Knowledge Graph.
- Edges: CALL, INHERITS_FROM, NESTED_IN
- Explicit import links from within the project are ignored, modeled as a direct relationship from CALL context to -> DEFINITION context

### Notes
- The parsing of code ignores files inside any folder called tests.

## Instructions
### Installation
This project uses Astral's UV to manage dependencies. Using UV, the both sstatic and dynamic dependencies are robustly handled by the uv.lock file.

To install the project dependencies simply execute from the command-line:
```bash
uv sync
```
UV will automatically create a virtual environment with the necessary dependencies.

### Configuration
- If desired, modify `src/utils/config/config.py` to modify the fields and properties for Vector Index and Code Embedding in Neo4j.
- The prompts for each chain can be modified for finer prompt engineering in the file `src/utils/config/prompts.yaml`

### Usage
- Run streamlit with uv from the root folder as 
    ```bash
    uv run streamlit run streamlit.py
    ```
- Insert API Keys and Aura DB credentials on the sidebar. None of them are stored as you can check on the `streamlit.py` code. Aura DB offers a free tier account that you can use and is more than enough for most codebases.
- Insert your project's code as a ZIP or RAR file on the *Codebase RAG Source* section. Knowledge Graph creation from the codebase and push to Neo4j may take a while, depending on project size. Once the Knowledge Graph has been uploaded to Neo4j, the Chatbot has your code project inside his brain ðŸ§ !
- If desired, you can choose the OpenAI model to use with the Chatbot.
- You can now ask the chat questions like "What pieces of the code would I have to modify to adapt for changes in the X method from the Y class?"

## Packages



## Next steps
- Create unit tests
- Refactor project to divide in 3 to separately deployments; 
    1. Code database creation
    2. RAG LLMs 
    3. Frontend app 
- Refactor graph build and upload to Neo4j processes to asynchronous and parallel to make the RAG knowledge base creation faster. 
- Adapt for private LLM endpoint integration
- Add option to plug in official code documentation
